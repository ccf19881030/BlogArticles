- [Elastic Nodes Example](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwidgets-graphicsview-elasticnodes-example.html)
Demonstrates how to interact with graphical items in a scene.

The Elastic Nodes example shows how to implement edges between nodes in a graph, with basic interaction. You can click to drag a node around, and zoom in and out using the mouse wheel or the keyboard. Hitting the space bar will randomize the nodes. The example is also resolution independent; as you zoom in, the graphics remain crisp.
